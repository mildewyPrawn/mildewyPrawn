* Hello World! 👋
** About me

+ 🔭 I’m currently studying two BS: Computer Science, Mathematics.
+ I enjoy music and photography (other than programming).
+ Algorithms  fan. Haskell  enthusiast.
+ That's relevant
+ [[https://gitlab.com/mildewyPrawn][gitLab rulez]].

** Why this is empty
+ I don't like the gamification gitHub has.
+ This is probably the worst social network (more emojis than code (?)).
+ gitHub is probably not good (ICE Contract).
